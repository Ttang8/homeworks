  </p>

  <h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>200g dark chocolate</li>
    <li>100g unsalted butter, very soft</li>
    <li>25g caster suger</li>
    <li>4 large free range eggs, beaten to mix</li>
    <li>1tsp vanilla essence</li>
    <li>60g plain flour</li>
    <li>15cm square brownie tin or baking tin</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Heat the oven to 180C, gas 4. Break up the dark chocolate. Put into a heatproof bowl and melt gently in a pan over simmering water, making sure the water doesn't touch the base of the bowl. Remove the bowl from the heat and leave to cool until needed.
    </li>
    <li>
      Put the butter and sugar into the bowl of a food mixer and beat until fluffy. Gradually beat in the eggs, beating well after each addition. Beat in the vanilla essence.
    </li>
    <li>
      Spoon the cooled melted chocolate onto the mixture then mix in thoroughly. Sift the flour and cocoa powder onto the mixture and gently stir in.
    </li>
    <li>
      When completely combined, spoon the mixture into the prepared tin and spread evenly.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bake in the heated oven for about 20 mins until firm to the touch but still a bit fudgy. The chocolate will continue to cook slightly for a few mins after coming out of the oven.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remove the tin from the oven and set on a wire cooling rack. Leave the chocolate brownies to cool completely before cutting into pieces. Store the brownies in an airtight container and eat within 4 days.
    </li>
